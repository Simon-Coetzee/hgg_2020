## Course Abstract

The goal of this course is to take students on an in-depth tour of a
single common bioinformatics analysis pipeline. We will deconstruct the
RNA-seq analysis pipeline starting with the easiest, highest level
visualizations and working our way back through successively more
advanced techniques. We will start at the endpoint of the analysis, with
an existing, finalized dataset, going step-by-step through the pipeline
until we reach the very beginning with alignment and quality control
steps. We will emphasize practical utility of the methods, plus exposure
to important ideas and concepts for students to explore on their own at
a later date.

## Course Format

The course takes place over 6 weeks with 1.5 hour lectures on Tuesdays
and practical workshops on Thursdays for a total of 12 lectures and
workshops. Students should gain an understanding of what is involved
with this type of analysis and be able to use their notes to
recapitulate it with a future dataset if needed.

### Special considerations for COVID-19

Due to social distancing protocols the course will take place online via
a password-locked Zoom session. Details to be distributed via email.

## Expectations: Attendance, Homework & Grading

The course is worth 100 points. Homework is expected to be turned in on
time. Late assignments will be given a maximum of 50% of full credit up
to one lecture *after* the original due date. Recommended readings are
indicated on the syllabus. Assignment 1 is to choose one or more
transcription factors from the CRISPRi dataset and follow the lecture
series in completing the steps of an analysis pipeline from data
acquisition through through hypothesis testing and visualization. Each
stage of analysis and results is completed in successive homework
assignments (“Labs”) or question sets. Each question set is worth 10
points and will be graded based on completeness. Each student will also
be required to present their homework at least once during the course
during a workshop. For this informal presentation, the student will be
graded on their ability to discuss the figures they generated and any
challenges encountered (10 points). A final exam worth 30 points will be
given at the 12 lecture.

**Attendance is required** no exceptions. You may obtain permission
ahead of time or with extenuating circumstances after the fact from the
graduate school (email to Emma Yates Kassler). Homework assignments are
required on time (see schedule below) regardless of attendance or for
half credit **one lecture late**. Unexcused absences result in an
incomplete grade.
